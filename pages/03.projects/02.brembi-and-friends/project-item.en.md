LINE is the first chat app that opens it stickers store to public. Designers from all around the globe are submitting their characters into the LINE creators sticker market. Based on LINE official blog report. stickers come from 124 countries, with total sticker sales 1.23 billion Yen. That's solely from LINE Creator's Market. For designer, LINE Creator's Market is a good source of passive income. But, the competition is quite fierce. Right now there 9000+ stickers set in LINE Creators Market.

We avoid drawing too much details on characters and background. We focus on character expression instead of background or situations. The deeper our designer got into this project, the more interesting it became. The characters themselves don't have that much intrinsic meaning, but the way we've used them - we've socially embedded so much meaning into them. These characters have personalities and connotations to using them socially. That's not a technical invention, that's a social and cultural invention, something we've done to visualize ideas and make it pop to our client, Brembi and Friends.
