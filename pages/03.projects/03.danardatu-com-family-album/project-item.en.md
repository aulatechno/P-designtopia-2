Our special client, Heru Danardatu giving us a project to make a family album for his travelling experience and documentation. We have this creative elegant concept from our creative website developer and designer to fulfill his visual needs to make it look simple but super high quality.

Sometimes, less is more. It's a principle that today's online designers are increasingly coming to appreciate. With the growing use of mobile devices and the complications of responsive design, minimalism  is on the rise online. Minimalism brings additional benefits to websites, in the shape of faster loading times and better compability between screen sizes. Its simplicity seems attuned to mobile browsing, without harming the desktop experience.

It helps here to distinguish the minimalist philoshophy from the minimalist aesthetic, though both can be applied to web design. The minimalist aesthetic is the visual representation of that philosophy. Minimalism uses a lot of white or at least uniformly coloured space.
