        <li>All estimated prices quoted, whether written or verbal, are for the listed and mentioned services only. Any additional services required to complete a project will be quoted for in advance and charged accordingly. Deliveries and couriers are additional.</li>
        <li>A signed Project Order (preferably with a PO number and project value) will need to be raised for the full quoted and agreed amount before work can commence on any job. A separate PO may need to be raised for any extras such as distribution, storage, deliveries or mailing.</li>
        <li>All work is billed on completion of project stage, or the relevant hourly charge as previously agreed.</li>
        <li>All estimates are based on expected or agreed design time and include two sets of authors corrections where alterations are called for by the Client, or if additional changes are required by client.</li>
        <li>Where there is a change of brief, the Company will inform the Client in advance of any extra costs likely to be incurred.</li>
        <li>All projects are planned to an agreed schedule. Non-adherence to this schedule by the Client may result in compromising final delivery deadlines. If this is likely to occur, the Company will advise the Client as soon as this becomes evident and suggest an alternative solution where feasible. This may incur additional costs. </li>
        <li>Whilst every effort will be made to achieve agreed delivery, the Company cannot accept liability or be held financially responsible for any targets or deadlines being missed for delivery of any work which is outside of the Company’s control.</li>
        <li>For all new clients payment for the full or part amount may be requested in advance of commencement, as agreed between parties. For any subsequent invoiced work, the Company must receive full payment not later than 14 days after the date of Invoice (for project value under one million).</li>
        <li>Once a client has agreed to the Company’s current Terms and Conditions on a credit account with the company, Designtopia shall invoice in project stages e.g. Detailed Design and Design Development etc. Upon stage completion unless where exceptional terms have been agreed with the client.</li>
        <li>Designtopia reserves the right to invoice for any disbursements for part works carried out including third party costs incurred on a project should the project be unable to be completed for any reason or has been delayed/put on hold by the Client for a period of 4 weeks or more then stage invoicing will occur.</li>
        <li>In good faith, Designtopia would hold any supplied files, originals and materials for a period of up to 3 months. Resumption of works on the project would be completed according to the original schedule of costs so long as the project specification remained unaltered.</li>
        <li>Disbursements on behalf of any client may result in a request for payment in advance from the Client.</li>
        <li>All creative work produced and devised during a project(s), creative, digital, software files and related correspondence remain the property – physically, intellectually and in copyright, of the Company until full payment has been made on the Client’s account, and all project costs have been cleared.</li>

Designtopia will not accept responsibility/liability for infringements caused by any wrongly supplied materials.</li>
        <li>The Company reserves the right to commission freelance support or outsource any job if it is felt it is in the best interests of the Client.

        <li>The Company cannot guarantee the Client exclusivity of any marketing concept, strategy, design or other intellectual property provided. Therefore the Company will not accept liability for any alleged claim from the Client or any Third Party as the result of unintentional similarity in part or whole of a Third Party’s copyright protected or registered trademark or brand, identity, strapline, colour usage, image style and content, product or otherwise.</li>
        <li>It remains the Client’s responsibility to seek copyright protection if desired for any creative/intellectual property provided to the Client by the Company.</li>
        <li>If at any point during the design or development cycle a client wishes to cancel, they may do so but will be invoiced an amount that Designtopia judges to be proportional to the amount of work completed on the commission and further compensatory charges for booked design time or printing press time or any other supply costs accruing.</li>

        <li>Terms and Conditions may be changed at any time without prior notice to its clients. Notification will be sent to all clients at the time of the Terms and Conditions alterations.</li>
