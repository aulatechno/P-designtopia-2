      <h4><li>How do I write a good design brief?</li></h4>
        <p>Writing an on-point design brief is the first key to success when running a design you need (Logo, stationery, banner, etc). An effective brief gives designers everything they need to know to exceed your expectations.</p>
        <p>At Designtopia, we make it easy with our online brief by form.</p>
        <p>To help, here’s what a good design brief includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your brand and business: A quick 2-3 sentence summary is perfect.</li>
          <li>Target audience: Here, you might say something like, “Both men and women between the ages of 25 and 40 who are looking for outdoor adventures”.</li>
          <li>Values to communicate with your design: What feelings and messages do you want the visual design to communicate to your viewer?</li>
          <li>Stylistic preferences: Whether you want something artistic and bold or sophisticated and minimal, this is your chance to let designers know.  </li>
          <li>Colors: Set on particular colors? List them here.</li>
          <li>Example images: Trust us, one of the best ways to inform and inspire your designers is to provide images of other designs you like. A good way to do this is making a Pinterest board and linking to it in your brief.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You’re now ready to get a design you love!</p>

      <h4><li>Which package should I choose for my design needs?</li></h4>
        <p>In choosing your package, think about how much experience you have briefing and working with designers, and how much feedback you’ll be able to give each one. The more you put into your designs, the more you’ll get out. Also ask yourself:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>What level of design quality and variety do you need? Packages with bigger prices tend to attract better customers, and get more designs.</li>
            <li>How much support would you like from Designtopia? If you’ve never worked with designers before, our packages include an account manager who’ll work with you to make your design as successful as possible.</li>
            <li>You can choose the package you want as part of our online briefing process. Each package costs a different price, and gives you different features. Generally, the more you pay:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>The more designs you’ll get to choose from.</li>
              <li>The better the quality of designs you’ll get.</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
        <br />
        <p>You can also name your own price or make your custom design package. To do that, send us an email with subject “I want to create a custom package” and we will inform you right away!</p>

      <h4><li>When do I pay for the design?</li></h4>
        <p>At Designtopia, you pay for your design service up front with down payment 30% of the project or design package fees. Then, you have to pay the rest of the payment after you closed the project.</p>

      <h4><li>What payment methods do you accept?</li></h4>
        <p>You can pay for your design or project using:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>PayPal</li>
            <li>Bank Transfer (BCA)</li>
          </ul>
        <br />
        <p>The currency you’ll be charged will depend on which local Designtopia site (IDR) you use to make the payment.</p>

      <h4><li>What currency do I pay for the contest in?</li></h4>
        <p>Currency is determined by location. Our local sites are listed in Indonesia. So, we will suggest you to pay in IDR (Indonesian Rupiah).</p>

      <h4><li>How do I contact the designer?</li></h4>
        <p>To get in touch with the designer, you can send them a message via email or through a Private Message (Skype, WhatsApp, Line, etc). Communication made here is only between you and the designer; it is not public.</p>

      <h4><li>When do I sign the Copyright Transfer Agreement?</li></h4>
        <p>As a designer, the first steps in the design Handover stage are uploading the final design files, and we will send you Design Transfer Agreement.</p>

        <p>You will be notified that files have been uploaded to your Handover. You'll then get all the design files you need (to be printed, shared, etc) and after downloading and checking the final design files you’ll release the rest of the design payment.</p>

        <p>It's important to note that the Design Transfer Agreement once signed only transfers ownership over the design after the design payment has been paid to Designtopia. Between signing the agreement and releasing the design payment, the client will still be able to request small tweaks to the final design if required.</p>

      <h4><li>What is the client guidelines?</li></h4>
        <p>Respect the community: Be polite and professional when communicating with the designers and Designtopia staff.</p>
        <p>Be clear: You get what you ask for, so be as clear as possible in describing your project.</p>
        <p>Provide regular feedback: Feedback is the key to getting a great result! You don’t have to comment on every design, but remember: designers won’t know how you feel unless you tell them.</p>
        <p>Keep it clean: Please do not post a design project that contains objectionable subject matter — nothing obscene, pornographic or offensive is allowed here.</p>
        <p>Respect copyright: Do not ask one designer to copy the work of another designer. Remember, you only own the designs that you pay for.</p>
        <p>Be honest: Don’t misrepresent yourself, create multiple accounts, or attempt to defraud Designtopia or the design community.</p>
