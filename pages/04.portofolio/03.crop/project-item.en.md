In preparing the layout of a tabloid, it is necessary to have knowledge about the type and color of font or typeface, besides an artistic soul. Because of the size of the font for headlines, long story, and a large color photograph or writing affects the reader’s eye. The position of a message, the content and patterns used are all designed to facilitate the reader in scanning. Thus, newspaper layout needs to be adjusted to its target audience.

Column forms layout is important for the newspaper, but other than that there is another one that is not less important, the white space. The use of white space is useful to help the reader focus on the main content; white space also separates the elements. Proper use of empty space also helps the reader to enjoy a newspaper page, so that makes the reader feel more comfortable. White space is usually well placed as the distance between the news with advertising.
